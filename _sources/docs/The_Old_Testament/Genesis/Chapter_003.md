## MAN'S DISOBEDIENCE

(GENESIS_3_1)=
1. Now the serpent was more subtile than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of garden?
1. And the woman said unto the serpent, we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:
1. but of the fruit of the tree which *is* in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
1. And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:
1. for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eye shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.
1. And when the woman saw that the tree *was* good for food, and that it *was* pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make *one* wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.
1. And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that there *were* naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
1. And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and {ref}`Adam<WHO_Adam>` and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.
1. And the LORD called unto {ref}`Adam<WHO_Adam>`, and said unto him, Where *art* thou?
1. And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I *was* naked; and I hid myself.
1. And he said, Who told thee that thou *was* naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shoudest not eat?
1. And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to *be* with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.

A man and a woman sit under the Tree of Life as a snake rears up beside the woman, in a scene similar to that of the serpent in the Garden of Eden. A small cylinder seal -- one of thousands excavated in Mesopotamia -- was used to impress the scene into clay at Babylon, about 2500 B.C.
