# CHAPTER FOUR

## CAIN AND ABEL
1. And {ref}`Adam<WHO_Adam>` knew {ref}`Eve<WHO_Eve>` his wife; and she conceived, and bare {ref}`Cain<WHO_Cain>`, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.
1. And she again bare his brother {ref}`Abel<WHO_Abel>`. And {ref}`Abel<WHO_Abel>` was a keeper of sheep, but {ref}`Cain<WHO_Cain>` was a tiller of the ground.
1. And in process of time it come to pass, that {ref}`Cain<WHO_Cain>` brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.
1. And {ref}`Abel<WHO_Abel>`, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto {ref}`Abel<WHO_Abel>` and to his offering:
1. but unto {ref}`Cain<WHO_Cain>` and to his offering he had not respect. And {ref}`Cain<WHO_Cain>` was very wroth, and his countenance fell.
1. And the LORD said unto {ref}`Cain<WHO_Cain>`, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?
1. If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door: and unto thee *shall* be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.
1. And {ref}`Cain<WHO_Cain>` talked with {ref}`Abel<WHO_Abel>` his brother: and it come to pass, when they were in the field, that {ref}`Cain<WHO_Cain>` rose up against {ref}`Abel<WHO_Abel>` his brother, and slew him.
1. And the LORD said unto {ref}`Cain<WHO_Cain>`, where *is* {ref}`Abel<WHO_Abel>` thy brother? and he said, I know not: *Am* I my brother's keeper?
1. And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground.

When did man first use orchestral instrument? More than 2,500 years before Christ, according to a bas-relief excavated at Adab in Sumer. It shows a man (left) -- perhaps the conductor -- holding a leafy batom while two harpists, one with a seven-stringed harp, the other with one that has five strings, march toward the conductor, followed by a drummer and a trumpeter. The figures above them are apparently dancers.([Image courtesy](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/Mesopotamia%2C_Periodo_proto-dinastico%2C_frammento_di_contenitore_in_clorite_con_procesisone_di_musici%2C_2700-2500_ac_ca%2C_da_bismaya.jpg), Sailko, [CC BY 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0), via Wikimedia Commons.
