Revered along with **{ref}`Daniel<WHO_Daniel>`** and **{ref}`Job<WHO_Job>`** as one of ancient Israel's three righteous men, Noah plays two important roles in history. First, he is virtually the second father of humankind, because all of **{ref}`Adam<WHO_Adam>`**'s other descendants were destroyed in the great Flood that covered the world more than 1,600 years after creation. In that role, he acts as a link between the fragmentary accounts of humanity's first generations and the more detailed biographies of Israel's patriarchs that follow in the book of {ref}`Genesis<INTRO_GENESIS>`. Second, he is the discoverer of viniculture, or the growing of grapes, and the first person known to make wine.

Born to the tenth generation to follow Adam, 126 years after his death, Noah was marked for greatness from birth. According to his fater, **{ref}`Lambech<WHO_Lamech>`**, the very name Noah implies that "out of the ground which the Lord has cursed this one shall bring us relief from our work and from the toil of our hands" ({ref}`Gen. 5:29<GENESIS_5_29>`). The next thing in the Scriptures tell us about Noah is that, after he was 500 years old, he sired three sons: **{ref}`Shem<WHO_Shem>`**, **{ref}`Ham<WHO_Ham>`**, and **{ref}`Japheth<WHO_Japheth>`**.

During these centuries, humanity evidently grew so wicked that the Lord decided to cleanse the earth of evil with a tremendous flood that would annihilate virtually all life: "I will blot out man whom I have created from the face of the ground, man and east and creeping things and birds of the air, for I am sorry that I have them them" ({ref}`Gen. 6:7<GENESIS_6_7>`). But because Noah, who was by then 600 years old, had remained steadfast in fath, indeed "a righteous man, blameless in his generation" ({ref}`Gen. 6:9<GENESIS_6_9>`). God was moved to save him and his family from the worldwide devastation.

## A VESSEL DESIGNED BY GOD

Following divine instructions, Noah constructed a huge ark out of [gopher wood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_wood), which may have been [cypress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypress) (the word "gopher" is nowhere else used in the Bible). Inside and out the three-deck vessel, no doubt honeycombed with partitions to make many separate compartments, was caulked with [bitumen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitumen), a mineral pitch used for waterproofing in the [ancient Near East](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Near_East). The dimensions of the rectangular craft are given in {ref}`Genesis<GENESIS>` in [cubits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubit), a standard of measurement that was perhaps the equivalent about 18 inches. The ark, therefore, was 450 feet long, 75 feet wide, and 45 feet high, better designed for stability in floating than cruising. Into this strange vessel -- little more than a buoyant box -- the sole human being who had "found favor in the eyes of the Lord" ({ref}`Gen. 6:8<GENESIS_6_8>`) led his family along with seven pairs of ritually clean animals, a pair of each unclean animal, and seven pairs of each type of bird.

Seven days later, as God had warned, great torrents of rain began falling from skies and did not cease for a total of 40 days and nights. The landscape was obliterated, and every one of the sinful progeny of {ref}`Adam<WHO_Adam>` and **{ref}`Eve<WHO_Eve>`** was drowned. But as the waters inexorably rose and covered even the highest mountains, Noah and family remained safe, protected within the mammoth ark.

## DELIVERANCE, OLD AND NEW


## THE BABLONIAN NOAH

**Flood stories were** common among the literary traditions of Israel's neighbors, but the most famous ancient parallel to the biblical story of Noah occurs in the Babylonian [epic of Gilgamesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_of_Gilgamesh). When the hero [Gilgamesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilgamesh) goes on a journey to discover the secret of eternal life, he encounters a man name [Utnapishtim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utnapishtim), who had been warned that the god [Enlil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlil) intended to drown humankind because the people gave him insomnia.

As in {ref}`Genesis<GENESIS>`, a chosen mortal is given specific instructions for building the boat that will provide an escape for him and his family. During the deluge, which lasts seven days, the vessel carries the seeds of all life, along with [Utnapishtim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utnapishtim) and his family. When  [Gilgamesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilgamesh) meets him, [Utnapishtim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utnapishtim) has become immortal.

## THE GENERATIONS OF ADAM

**Humanity's history** from creation to the Flood, {ref}`Adam<WHO_Adam>` to Noah, is abridged in {ref}`Genesis 5<GENESIS_5>`. The recitation of names cover 1,656 years -- that is, from the beginning of {ref}`Adam<WHO_Adam>`'s 930-year lifespan to the great deluge that occurred when Noah was 600 years old.

Like {ref}`Genesis<GENESIS>`, Babylonian tradition records ten heroes before the Floow, the seventh of which -- like {ref}`Enoch<WHO_Enoch>` in the Bible -- was spared death, called to walk with God in heaven. Although the ages assigned the descendants of {ref}`Adam<WHO_Adam>` range from {ref}`Enoch<WHO_Enoch>`'s 365 years to {ref}`Methuselah<WHO_Methuselah>`'s record longevity of 969 years, they are brief in comparison with ages Babylonians assigned their heroic ancestors. The ten biblical names are repeated with two variations, in {ref}`Luke<LUKE>` {ref}`3<LUKE_3>`:{ref}`36<LUKE_3_36>`-{ref}`38<LUKE_3_38>`.
