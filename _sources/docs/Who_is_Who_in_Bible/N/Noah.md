Revered along with **{ref}`Daniel<WHO_Daniel>`** and **{ref}`Job<WHO_Job>`** as one of ancient Israel's three righteous men, Noah plays two important roles in history. First, he is virtually the second father of humankind, because all of **{ref}`Adam<WHO_Adam>`**'s other descendants were destroyed in the great Flood that covered the world more than 1,600 years after creation. In that role, he acts as a link between the fragmentary accounts of humanity's first generations and the more detailed biographies of Israel's patriarchs that follow in the book of {ref}`Genesis<INTRO_GENESIS>`. Second, he is the discoverer of viniculture, or the growing of grapes, and the first person known to make wine.

Born to the tenth generation to follow Adam, 126 years after his death, Noah was marked for greatness from birth. According to his fater, **{ref}`Lambech<WHO_Lamech>`**, the very name Noah implies that "out of the ground which the Lord has cursed this one shall bring us relief from our work and from the toil of our hands" ({ref}`Gen. 5:29<GENESIS_5_29>`). The next thing in the Scriptures tell us about Noah is that, after he was 500 years old, he sired three sons: **{ref}`Shem<WHO_Shem>`**, **{ref}`Ham<WHO_Ham>`**, and **{ref}`Japheth<WHO_Japheth>`**.

During these centuries, humanity evidently grew so wicked that the Lord decided to cleanse the earth of evil with a tremendous flood that would annihilate virtually all life: "I will blot out man whom I have created from the face of the ground, man and east and creeping things and birds of the air, for I am sorry that I have them them" ({ref}`Gen. 6:7<GENESIS_6_7>`). But because Noah, who was by then 600 years old, had remained steadfast in fath, indeed "a righteous man, blameless in his generation" ({ref}`Gen. 6:9<GENESIS_6_9>`). God was moved to save him and his family from the worldwide devastation.

## A VESSEL DESIGNED BY GOD

Following divine instructions, Noah constructed a huge ark out of [gopher wood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_wood), which may have been [cypress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypress) (the word "gopher" is nowhere else used in the Bible). Inside and out the three-deck vessel, no doubt honeycombed with partitions to make many separate compartments, was caulked with [bitumen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitumen), a mineral pitch used for waterproofing in the [ancient Near East](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Near_East). The dimensions of the rectangular craft are given in {ref}`Genesis<GENESIS>` in [cubits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubit), a standard of measurement that was perhaps the equivalent about 18 inches. The ark, therefore, was 450 feet long, 75 feet wide, and 45 feet high, better designed for stability in floating than cruising. Into this strange vessel -- little more than a buoyant box -- the sole human being who had "found favor in the eyes of the Lord" ({ref}`Gen. 6:8<GENESIS_6_8>`) led his family along with seven pairs of ritually clean animals, a pair of each unclean animal, and seven pairs of each type of bird.

Seven days later, as God had warned, great torrents of rain began falling from skies and did not cease for a total of 40 days and nights. The landscape was obliterated, and every one of the sinful progeny of {ref}`Adam<WHO_Adam>` and **{ref}`Eve<WHO_Eve>`** was drowned. But as the waters inexorably rose and covered even the highest mountains, Noah and family remained safe, protected within the mammoth ark.

```

The Flood remained at full strength for 150 days, until "{ref}`God made a wind blow over the earth, and the waters subsided<GENESIS_8_1>`; {ref}`the fountains of the deep and the windows of heavens were closed, the rain from the heavens was restrained<GENESIS_8_2>`, {ref}`and the waters receded from the earth continually<GENESIS_8_3>`" ({ref}`Gen.<GENESIS>` {ref}`8<GENESIS_8>`:{ref}`1<GENESIS_8_1>`-{ref}`3<GENESIS_8_3>`). It took another 150 days for the water level to drop low enough to let the ark come to rest upon a mountain in the region of [Armenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenia) known as [Ararat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Ararat#:~:text=Nevertheless%2C%20Ararat%20is%20traditionally%20considered,landing%20place%20during%20that%20time.). Yet 40 more days passed before Noah tested the situation by releasing a raven, which did not return. A week later, he sent out a dove, which came back because it could not find a dry spot to rest upon. Released again the following week, the dove returned with a fresh olive leaf in its beak, an indication that the flood-waters had subsided. When Noah sent out the dove a third time, seven days later, the bird did not return. As last, "{ref}`the face of the ground was dry<GENESIS_8_13>`" ({ref}`Gen.<GENESIS>` {ref}`8<GENESIS_8>`:{ref}`13<GENESIS_8_13>`).

The human and animal survivors left the ark, and Noah build an alter. After he had made a prodigious blood sacrifice that included every ritually clean animal and bird, God was pleased and promised that he would never again annihilate all living things, nor would the natural order of the seasons ever again be disrupted in such a catastrophic fasion. As token of his universal covenant with all human beings to come and all other living creatures as well, God placed a rainbow in the heavens. Interestingly, there is no specific word for "rainbow" in ancient Hebrew. Some biblical experts believe that the scriptural reference is a poetic use of the word "bow", the weapon. In that case, God can be seen as laying down his bow as a highly visible sign of his truce with humankind. To accent Noah's role as ancestor of the renewed human race, God repeated the edict he had given {ref}`Adam<WHO_Adam>` so many centuries before: "{ref}`Be fruitful and multiply, and full the earth<GENESIS_9_1>`" ({ref}`Gen.<GENESIS>` {ref}`9<GENESIS_9>`:{ref}`1<GENESIS_9_1>`). There is one significant contrast: {ref}`Adam<WHO_Adam>` and immediate descendants were vegetarians, but after the Flood, God said, "{ref}`every moving thing that lives shall be food for you; and as I gave you the green plants, I give you everything<GENESIS_9_3>`" ({ref}`Gen.<GENESIS>` {ref}`9<GENESIS_9>`:{ref}`3<GENESIS_9_3>`).

The commands then given to Noah, supported by the implies connection with {ref}`Adam<WHO_Adam>`, led to the development in Jewish tradition of the seven so-called [Noachide laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Laws_of_Noah). Briefly stated, these include six proscriptions -- against [idolatry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idolatry), [bloodshed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder), [blasphemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_capital_crimes_in_the_Torah), [theft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft), [sexual sins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adultery), and [eating the flesh of a living animal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_live_animals) -- and the charge to set up a [legal system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary). Because these seven concepts reflect divine commands to Noah and {ref}`Adam<WHO_Adam>`, the ancestors of all humankind, Jewish thinkers believed that they define moral obligations laid by God upon everyone, Jew and [Gentile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentile) alike. Therefore, Noah is seen in traditional rabbinical thought as a symbol of the unity of human beings throughout all generations. Indeed, the Scriptures stress that from Noah and his sons "{ref}`the whole earth was peopled<GENESIS_9_19>`" ({ref}`Gen.<GENESIS>` {ref}`9<GENESIS_9>`:{ref}`19<GENESIS_9_19>`).

## SEEING HIS FATHER'S SHAME

Yet the new beginning for the human race would not be without conflict and error. In his second major historical role, Noah discovered not only the process of making wine but also the hazards of overindulgence. When he drank to excess and passed out in his tent, his son {ref}`Ham<WHO_Ham>` discovered him naked and unconscious. No doubt smirking, {ref}`Ham<WHO_Ham>` ran off to share the jest with his brothers. More respectful, {ref}`Shem<WHO_Shem>` and {ref}`Japheth<WHO_Japheth>` walked backward into their father's tent, so that they would not add to his shame, and tossed a garment over him. As punishment for his gross insult to a parent, {ref}`Ham<WHO_Ham>` -- in his bibliocal passage referred to as **{ref}`Canaan<WHO_Canaan>`**, the name later given to {ref}`Ham<WHO_Ham>`'s fourth son -- was cursed: "{ref}`A slave of slaves shall he be to his brothers<GENESIS_9_25>`" ({ref}`Gen.<GENESIS>` {ref}`9<GENESIS_9>`:{ref}`25<GENESIS_9_25>`).

Biblical scholars caution today's reader about the proper interpretation of this incident. From the ancient point of view, viniculture was considered fundamental to civilized living, and wine making was thought to be an appropriate use of the grape. Nor does the account in {ref}`Genesis<GENESIS>` criticize Noah for becoming intoxicated. In other words, the intent of the story is not to warn against drunkenness but to offer an explanation for the traditional Hebrew contempt for the [Canaanites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canaan#Canaanites), their long-standing adversaries in the [Promised Land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promised_Land). According to the Scriptures, {ref}`Ham<WHO_Ham>`'s descendants also included several other tribes that were later under the control of [Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt). In the Islamic tradition, {ref}`Ham<WHO_Ham>` is considered the ancestor of the [Copts of Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copts_in_Egypt), the [Berbers of North Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berbers), and unidentified black people.

Although archeologists have not yet uncovered evidence for an extraordinarily devastating deluge in ancient times, the historicity of the Flood is supported by a number of even older traditions from the cultures to the north and east of Palestine in [Mesopotamia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopotamia). But while the similarities between the Mesopotaminan legends and the Old Testament story are striking, there is an essential difference: Noah, unlike the heroes of those flood myths, does not win immortality but dies. His fate is linked with that of his descendants, the whole of humanity that follows him. Similarly, the parallel flood tales in [ancient Persian and Indian mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_flood_myths) do not have the ethical and religious resonance of the saga in {ref}`Genesis<GENESIS>`.

God's covenant with Noah, for example, is recalled by the prophet **{ref}`Isaiah<WHO_Isaiah>`** in order to remind his dejected people that divine compassion is great and everlasting. "As I swore that the water of Noah should no more go over earth," the Lord speaks through {ref}`Isaiah<WHO_Isaiah>`, "{ref}`so I have sworn that I will not be angry with you and will not rebuke you<ISAIAH_54_9>`" ({ref}`Is.<ISAIAH>` {ref}`54<ISAIAH_54>`:{ref}`9<ISAIAH_54_9>`). However, if he determined to vent his wrath upon the land, the Lord declared on another occasion, "even if Noah, {ref}`Daniel<WHO_Daniel>`, and {ref}`Job<WHO_Job>` went in it," they could not save others and "{ref}`would deliver but their own lives by their righteousness<EZEKIEL_14_20>`" ({ref}`Ezek.<EZEKIEL>` {ref}`14<EZEKIEL_14>`:{ref}`20<EZEKIEL_14_20>`).

## DELIVERANCE, OLD AND NEW


## THE BABLONIAN NOAH

**Flood stories were** common among the literary traditions of Israel's neighbors, but the most famous ancient parallel to the biblical story of Noah occurs in the Babylonian [epic of Gilgamesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_of_Gilgamesh). When the hero [Gilgamesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilgamesh) goes on a journey to discover the secret of eternal life, he encounters a man name [Utnapishtim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utnapishtim), who had been warned that the god [Enlil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlil) intended to drown humankind because the people gave him insomnia.

As in {ref}`Genesis<GENESIS>`, a chosen mortal is given specific instructions for building the boat that will provide an escape for him and his family. During the deluge, which lasts seven days, the vessel carries the seeds of all life, along with [Utnapishtim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utnapishtim) and his family. When  [Gilgamesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilgamesh) meets him, [Utnapishtim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utnapishtim) has become immortal.

## THE GENERATIONS OF ADAM

**Humanity's history** from creation to the Flood, {ref}`Adam<WHO_Adam>` to Noah, is abridged in {ref}`Genesis 5<GENESIS_5>`. The recitation of names cover 1,656 years -- that is, from the beginning of {ref}`Adam<WHO_Adam>`'s 930-year lifespan to the great deluge that occurred when Noah was 600 years old.

Like {ref}`Genesis<GENESIS>`, Babylonian tradition records ten heroes before the Floow, the seventh of which -- like {ref}`Enoch<WHO_Enoch>` in the Bible -- was spared death, called to walk with God in heaven. Although the ages assigned the descendants of {ref}`Adam<WHO_Adam>` range from {ref}`Enoch<WHO_Enoch>`'s 365 years to {ref}`Methuselah<WHO_Methuselah>`'s record longevity of 969 years, they are brief in comparison with ages Babylonians assigned their heroic ancestors. The ten biblical names are repeated with two variations, in {ref}`Luke<LUKE>` {ref}`3<LUKE_3>`:{ref}`36<LUKE_3_36>`-{ref}`38<LUKE_3_38>`.
