Revered along with {ref}`Daniel<WHO_Daniel>` and {ref}`Job<WHO_Job>` as one of ancient Israel's three righteous men, Noah plays two important roles in history. First, he is virtually the second father of humankind, because all of {ref}`Adam<WHO_Adam>`'s other descendants were destroyed in the great Flood that covered the world more than 1,600 years after creation. In that role, he acts as a link between the fragmentary accounts of humanity's first generations and the more detailed biographies of Israel's patriarchs that follow in the book of {ref}`Genesis<INTRO_GENESIS>`. Second, he is the discoverer of viniculture, or the growing of grapes, and the first person known to make wine.
