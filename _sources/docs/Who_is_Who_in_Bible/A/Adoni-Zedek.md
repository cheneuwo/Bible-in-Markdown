# Adoni-Zedek

(ah doh' nee zee' dek) HEBREW: ADONI-ZEDEK

*"my lord is Zedek/righteous"*

The kind of Jerusalem in the time of {ref}`Joshua<WHO_Joshua>`, Adoni-zedek allied himself with four other local rules to crush the city of Gibeon, which had made peace with the Hebrew invaders. The beleaguered Gibeonites called on Joshua for aid and, with the miraculous help of a severe hailstorm and a standing still of the sun, the Israelites defeated Adoni-zedek and his allies. The kings were captured and executed, their bodies thrown into the same cave where they had hidden during the battle.
