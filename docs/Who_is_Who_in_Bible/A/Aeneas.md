# Aeneas

(uh nee' uhs) HEBREW: AINEAS

*"praiseworthy"*

The apostle {ref}`Peter<WHO_Peter>` made several journeys to exhort and encourage the faithful of the early church. On a trip to [Lydda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lod), a town on the [plain of Sharon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharon_plain) some 25 miles norwest of [Jerusalem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem), he met a man named Aeneas, who had been paralyzed and bedridden for eight years. Telling Aneas that "Jesus Christ heals you" ({ref}`Acts<ACTS>` {ref}`9<ACTS_9>`:{ref}`34<ACTS_9_34>`), Peter cured him -- a miracle that converted many.
