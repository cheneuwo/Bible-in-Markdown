# Agabus

(ag' uh buhs) GREEK: AGABOS

*possibly "locust"*

Prophets in the early Christian community, like their Old Testament predecessors, were believed to be divinely inspired. Agabus, a prophet of [Jerusalem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem), was therefore given a respectful hearing when he warned the church at Antioch of an impending famine. The famine indeed took place during the reign of the emperor {ref}`Claudius<WHO_Claudius>`. Later, Agabus warned {ref}`Paul<WHO_Paul>` that the Jews would have him arrested by Roman soldiers if he returned to Jerusalem; this prophecy too was fulfilled.
