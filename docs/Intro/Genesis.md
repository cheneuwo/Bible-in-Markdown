# GENESIS

The book of beginnings: The first part describes the creation of the physical university and of man (1--2), and then tells how man's first sin brought disaster in the form of a universal floor (3--8). Only {ref}`Noah<WHO_Noah>` and his family survived, and from them the whole human race is descended (9--11; see captions on page 9--13). The second part of the book (12--50) contains the story of the earliest ancestors of the people of Israel: the patriarchs {ref}`Abraham<WHO_Abraham>` (12--23; see map on page 16), {ref}`Isaac<WHO_Isaac>` (24--26), and {ref}`Jacob<WHO_Jacob>` (27--36). Included are the narratives of the destruction of [Sodom and Gomorrah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodom_and_Gomorrah) (19), the sacrifice of {ref}`Isaac<WHO_Isaac>` (22), {ref}`Jacob<WHO_Jacob>`'s deceiving of his brother {ref}`Esau<WHO_Esau>` (27), and Jacob's wrestling with the angel (32:22-32). The book concludes with the story of {ref}`Joseph<WHO_Joseph>`, the son of {ref}`Jacob<WHO_Jacob>`, who, sold into bondage by his brothers, rose to power in Egypt and later used his power to save them (37--50; see caption on page 42).
