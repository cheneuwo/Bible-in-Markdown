# CHAPTER 2

1. Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.
1. And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
1. And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.

## MAN IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN
4. There *are* the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens,
4. and every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and *there was* not a man to till the ground.
4. But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.
4. And the LORD God formed man of the dust *of* the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.
(GENESIS_2_8)=
8. And LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.
8. And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
(GENESIS_2_10)=
10. And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.

A river flowed out of Eden and became four main branches, two of which are known with certainty: [the Tigris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tigris), called Hiddekel in the Bible, and [the Euphrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphrates). The map above shows the present course of these two rivers. What is today called the [Near East](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Near_East) is in the center of this map and is bounded roughly by five bodies of water: [the Mediterranean Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea), [the Black Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sea), [the Caspian Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspian_Sea), [the Persian Gulf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_Gulf), and [the Red Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea). Parentheses around these and certain other names on this map indicate names that through the centuries came to be used for these geographic features. Through generally barren -- with mountains, hills, and deserts -- the Near East contains a well-watered region from which arose the first great civilizations of the world. Because of its abundant vegetation and its shape, this region has been called [the Fertile Crescent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertile_Crescent); it extends from the Persian Gulf, which is the mouth of the mouth of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, northwestward before curving south along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea toward [the Nile Delta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nile_Delta). A map of the Fertile Crescent, tracing the route of Abraham on his journey to [Canaan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canaan), is on page xyz. In [the mountains of Ararat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountains_of_Ararat) (see above) Noah's ark came to rest after [the Flood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genesis_flood_narrative). A location in these mountains traditionally associated with this event is shown on page xyz.
