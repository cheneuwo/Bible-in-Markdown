A river flowed out of Eden and became four main branches, two of which are known with certainty: the Tigris, called Hiddekel in the Bible, and the Euphrates. The map above shows the present course of these two rivers. What is today called the Near East is in the center of this map and is bounded roughly by five bodies of water: the Mediterranean Sea, the Black Sea, the Caspian Sea, the Persian Gulf, and the Red Sea. Parentheses around these and certain other names on this map indicate names that through the centuries came to be used for these geographic features. Through generally barren -- with mountains, hills, and deserts -- the Near East contains a well-watered ergion from which arose the first great civilizations of the world. Because of its abundant vegetation and its shape, this region has been called the Fertile Crescent; it extends from the Persian Gulf, which is the mouth of the mouth of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, northwestward before curving south along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea toward the Nile Delta. A map of the Fertile Crescent, tracing the route of Abraham on his journey to Canaan, is on page xyz. In the mountains of Ararat (see above) Noah's ark came to rest after the Flood. A location in these mountains traditionally associated with this event is shown on page xyz.

And the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden ... And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads ... And the name of the third river is Hid'dekel: that is which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphra'tes. -- GENESIS 2:8,10,14
