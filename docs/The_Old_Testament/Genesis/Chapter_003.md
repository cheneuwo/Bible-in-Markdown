A man and a woman sit under the Tree of Life as a snake rears up beside the woman, in a scene similar to that of the serpent in the Garden of Eden. A small cylinder seal -- one of thousands excavated in Mesopotamia -- was used to impress the scene into clay at Babylon, about 2500 B.C.

Now the serpent was more subtile than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made -- GENESIS 3:1
